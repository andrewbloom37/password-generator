# password-generator

## About

This Node.js script will generate a memorable and secure password for you to use. It uses the crypto package to generate a random number, and then randomly assembles a mixture of English words and numbers to create a long string which may be used as a password. Take all normal precautions surrounding password use!

## Instructions

This assumes you have Node installed on your machine. Clone down this repo, navigate to it, and run `node passwordGenerator.js` from the command line. The script will log a string no less than 24 characters in length.
